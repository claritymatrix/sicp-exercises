; Exercise 1.45: We saw in Section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively 
; finding a fixed point of y ↦ x/y does not converge, and that this can be fixed by average 
; damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-
; damped y ↦ x/y².
;
; Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots - a single average damp is not 
; enough to make a fixed point search for y ↦ x/y³
