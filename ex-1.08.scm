; Exercise 1.08: Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact
; that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better
; approximation is given by the value 
; 
;       (x/yÂ² + 2y)
;       -----------
;            3
;
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to
; square-root procedure. (In Section 1.3.4 we will see how to
; implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these
; square-root and cube-root procedures.)
