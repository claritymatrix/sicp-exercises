# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

[This book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) is an introduction to thinking about computer programming and abstraction using a recursion-centric language called [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)). This text came out in 1984, before I was born, yet it is still relevant today. At the time of the book's writing, Lisp (the grandfather of Scheme) had existed for about 30 years.

Since Lisp is basically a mathematical formalism implemented in a machine, it will always be relevant, for the same reason that mathematics will always be relevant.

This repository is where I work out the exercises, I have not finished the book, but as I progress, the git log will tell the tale of my studies.
