; Exercise 1.24: Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise
; 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and test each of the
; 12 primes you found in that exercise.



			  

; Since the Fermat test has Theta(log(n)) growth, how would you
; expect the time to test primes near 1e12 to compare with the time
; to test primes near 1e15?

; Do your data bear this out?

; Can you explain any discrepancy you find?

; TODO: Finish this
