; Exercise 2.34: Evaluating a polynomial in x at a given value of x can
; be formulated as an accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial
; 
;   (a_n)x^n + (a_(n-1))x^(n-1) + ... + (a_1)x + a_0
;
; using a well-known algorithm called Horner's rule, which structures
; the computation as
;
; (...([a_n]x + [a_n-1])x + ... + a_1)x + a_0      (nested binomials)
;
; In other words, we start with a_n, multiply by x, add a_{n-1},
; multiply by x, and so on, until we reach a_0.
;
; Fill in the following template to produce a procedure that evaluates
; a polynomial using Hornerâ€™s rule. Assume that the coefficients of
; the polynomial are arranged in a sequence, from a_0 through a_n.
